already have:

Connection handling (WebSocketConfig).

Player registration (PlayerManager / GameController).

Frontend grid + puzzle panel.

Message models (GameMessage, GameJoinMessage, GameUpdate).

Missing pieces / improvements:

Puzzle logic (right now any answer claims a cell).

Clear separation of message types:

Use GameJoinMessage for state sync.

Use GameUpdate for tile claimed events.

Retire GameMessage (too generic).

Round/phase logic (e.g., “revenge” phase from your original plan).

Win condition detection + broadcast.
